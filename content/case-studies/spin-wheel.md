**Fold's bitcoin rewards were compelling but financially unsustainable.** I inherited the Spin Wheel—the app's most beloved feature—and evolved it through four major iterations over 18+ months, balancing user love against business economics while working with minimal engineering bandwidth.

## The Gap

When I inherited Spin Wheel, it was the app's most beloved feature—and its biggest financial liability.

The original mechanic tied spins to purchases: buy something with your Fold Card, get a spin, win sats (bitcoin). Users loved it. The problem? As Bitcoin's price rose, our reward costs scaled with it. A prize structure that worked at $20K Bitcoin became unsustainable at $60K Bitcoin. We were on track to price ourselves out of existence.

I needed to redesign the economics without killing the thing users loved most about the app.

## Understanding the Users

I had a unique advantage: I'd built the community these users lived in.

As Community Manager, I'd grown Fold's Discord to 40,000+ members. From that community, I created "Friends of Fold"—a group of 40+ power users who became our most direct feedback channel. But I didn't rely on them alone.

For every major iteration, I gathered feedback through multiple channels: Discord discussions with the broader community, Twitter polls to gauge sentiment from users who weren't in Discord, email surveys sent to our full user base, in-app notifications prompting feedback, and historical survey data from years of community engagement.

This multi-channel approach meant I heard from casual users and power users, from fans and critics. The insight that mattered most: users didn't care about the specific mechanic as much as they cared about feeling like they could win something meaningful.

## What We Built

### Four Iterations

**Iteration 1: Purchase-Tied Spins (Inherited)**
The original: every Fold Card purchase earned a spin. Simple, beloved, unsustainable. Prize costs scaled directly with Bitcoin price.

**Iteration 2: Spend-Based Spins**
We shifted from "every purchase = spin" to "spend thresholds = spins." Spend $50, get a spin. This gave us more control over cost per spin, but added complexity users had to understand.

**Iteration 3: Action-Based Spins**
I led strategy and implementation for a system where specific in-app actions earned spins—deposits, card purchases, referrals. The idea was to drive specific behaviors and build infrastructure for future engagement features. On paper, elegant. In practice, too complicated to explain, display, and execute with the bandwidth we had.

**Iteration 4: Daily Free Spins (Final)**
We landed on the simplest model: everyone gets a set number of free spins daily, capped. No complicated triggers, no spend thresholds, no action tracking. I built a financial model that made this sustainable at any Bitcoin price up to $120K.

### Supporting Features

**Self-service admin tooling:** I spec'd and shipped an internal tool to update the wheel—design, odds, prizes, copy, campaign duration—without engineering. Every seasonal theme, every sponsored campaign, every prize adjustment could happen without pulling engineers off roadmap work.

**Winner notifications:** I identified that FOMO drives engagement. When someone won a big prize, other users should know. Push notifications on major wins drove significant increases in DAU and daily spins.

**Sponsorship program:** I turned a cost center into a revenue stream. Designed tiered packages, created the sales playbook, ran GTM. Partners sponsored themed wheels with their branding. Generated six-figure revenue.

**Seasonal campaigns:** Quarterly themed refreshes with custom designs, adjusted prize pools, and coordinated GTM—like "Hot Sat Summer" with escalating prizes to drive engagement during slow periods.

## Product Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Simplify to daily free spins | Action-based system was too complex for our bandwidth. Simpler model we could actually execute well. |
| Build admin tooling first | A few engineering tickets gave me autonomy for every future update. Multiplied my impact without ongoing eng cost. |
| Cap spins per day | Created sustainable economics at any Bitcoin price. Model tested up to $120K BTC. |
| Add winner notifications | FOMO drives engagement. Seeing others win motivates spinning. |
| Create sponsorship tiers | Transformed cost center into revenue stream. Partners got themed exposure, we got paid. |

## The Complexity

The hardest part wasn't the product work—it was the constraint management.

At a lean startup, I didn't have dedicated engineering capacity. I'd get engineers for a ticket or two, not sprints. Whatever I built in that window needed to either solve the problem completely or give me tools to solve it myself going forward.

**The action-based system (Iteration 3) failed because I scoped it for a team I didn't have.** I wanted to build infrastructure for future engagement features. What I should have built was the simplest thing that worked with the bandwidth available.

This is why the self-service tooling mattered so much. A few engineering tickets gave me autonomy for every future update.

## The Tradeoff

Every iteration risked two things pulling in opposite directions:

**Alienating legacy users:** Our highest-value customers who loved the original mechanic and had strong opinions about changes.

**Inaccessibility to new users:** Every layer of complexity made it harder for new users to understand what we were offering.

These iterations happened over 18+ months, but from the outside—to someone not paying close attention—it looked like we were constantly changing. That's the tradeoff of iteration: it can look like indecision if you're not transparent about it.

We leaned into transparency. Every change came with honest communication: "This isn't sustainable. We're bummed too. Here's why we have to change it, here's what we're trying, and here's what's coming next."

And because we'd built genuine community trust over years—through direct CEO communication, through honest marketing, through actually listening to feedback—something remarkable happened: **our users defended us.**

When someone complained about the wheel getting "nuked," we didn't have to respond. Other community members would jump in: "They had to do this. Stick around. Remember Crypto Winter when every other company in this space died? Fold stayed."

That wasn't luck. That was years of transparent community building paying off when we needed it most.

## What I Learned

**Simpler is better.** Not as a platitude—as a survival strategy. When you don't have bandwidth to build something well, don't build it at all. Build the simpler thing you can actually execute.

**Build tools, not just features.** A few engineering tickets on admin tooling gave me more long-term value than a complex feature I couldn't maintain or iterate on.

**Iteration has a perception cost.** Too many changes too close together makes you look like you don't know what you're doing. Transparency helps, but it doesn't eliminate the cost.

**Community trust is a strategic asset.** The years I spent building Discord, being transparent, creating direct lines between leadership and users—all of that converted into users defending us during our hardest product changes. You can't manufacture that in a crisis. You have to build it before you need it.

**Cost structures need to survive success.** The original Spin Wheel failed because Bitcoin succeeded. Any reward system tied to an appreciating asset needs a model that works at 3x the current price.

**Accessibility matters in both directions.** Legacy users and new users have opposite needs. Every decision has to account for both, even when they conflict.

**Where American music came from—literally.**

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

I've been playing music since I was 12. It's not a hobby for me—it's part of how I process the world. And over the years, I've read a lot of music history: how blues became rock, how jazz fragmented into a dozen subgenres, how hip-hop emerged from specific blocks in the Bronx.

But here's what I kept noticing: the *where* matters as much as the *when*.

Delta blues sounds different from Chicago blues because the Great Migration changed who was playing it and who was listening. Nashville became country music's capital because of specific radio stations and specific business decisions. Motown's sound came from Detroit's factories—literally, the rhythm of the assembly line.

Music history is usually taught as a timeline. But it's really a map.

## What I'm Building

An interactive visualization of American music history from 1900 to 2000, plotted geographically. You can see where genres originated, how they spread, and how regional styles influenced each other.

**The data:** Over 2,600 events—first recordings, venue openings, cultural movements, pivotal performances—researched, dated, and geocoded.

**The interface:** A map you can explore by time period and genre. Zoom into Memphis in 1954 and see the constellation of events around Sun Studio. Follow the blues as it moves up the Mississippi. Watch hip-hop emerge in New York and spread outward.

## Why This Matters to Me

American music in the 20th century didn't just reflect American culture—it shaped global culture. Understanding where it came from helps you understand why it sounds the way it does. And there's something powerful about seeing that history as a physical journey across real places.

This is a personal project. I'm building it because I want it to exist.

## Overview

An interactive web application that visualizes your Spotify listening history as a geographical map, showing how your music taste has evolved over time and revealing patterns in your listening habits.

## Problem

Spotify Wrapped is fun but limited to year-end summaries. I wanted to create a tool that lets users explore their music taste evolution at any time, with rich visualizations and deeper insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, D3.js for visualizations
- **API**: Spotify Web API
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data
- **Auth**: OAuth with Spotify
- **Visualization**: D3.js, Chart.js

## Key Features

- Interactive timeline of listening history
- Genre "map" showing taste territories
- Artist relationship networks
- Mood and energy tracking over time
- Shareable music stories and highlights
- Discovery recommendations based on patterns
- Export visualizations as images/videos

## What I'm Learning

- Complex data visualization with D3.js
- Spotify API and OAuth implementation
- Processing and analyzing large datasets
- Creating engaging, shareable content
- Real-time data updates and streaming

## Technical Challenges

- Handling large volumes of listening history data
- Creating performant, interactive visualizations
- Designing intuitive representations of abstract music data
- Privacy and data handling best practices
- Making insights meaningful and actionable

## Next Steps

- Add social features for comparing with friends
- Create AI-powered playlist generation from patterns
- Add support for Apple Music and YouTube Music
- Build year-in-review video generation
- Implement collaborative music discovery
- Add festival/concert recommendation engine

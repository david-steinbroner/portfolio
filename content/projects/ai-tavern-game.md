## Overview

An AI-powered tabletop RPG (TTRPG) game optimized for mobile devices. Players engage in interactive storytelling powered by AI, making choices that dynamically shape the narrative.

## Problem

Traditional TTRPGs require a human dungeon master and aren't easily accessible on mobile. I wanted to create an experience that captures the magic of tabletop gaming while being playable anywhere, anytime.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, responsive mobile-first design
- **AI**: Claude API, ChatGPT integration
- **Platform**: Replit for rapid development and hosting
- **State Management**: React hooks for game state

## Key Features

- AI-powered dungeon master that responds to player actions
- Mobile-optimized interface for touch interactions
- Dynamic story generation based on player choices
- Character progression system
- Save/load game functionality

## What I Learned

- Working with AI APIs to create consistent, engaging narratives
- Mobile-first UI/UX design principles
- Balancing AI creativity with game structure
- Rapid prototyping and iteration with Replit

## Next Steps

- Add character creation and customization
- Implement party-based gameplay
- Create reusable adventure templates
- Add sound effects and ambient music
- Build analytics to track player engagement patterns

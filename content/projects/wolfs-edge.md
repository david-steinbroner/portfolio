## Overview

Managed the business operations for Wolf's Edge, a survival thriller graphic novel, from Kickstarter crowdfunding through fulfillment and ongoing e-commerce sales. This project required campaign management, customer data migration, and strategic planning for long-term product sustainability.

## Project Scope

### Crowdfunding Campaign Management
- **Platform**: Kickstarter
- **Campaign Tracking**: Multiple export snapshots (Sept 16 & Sept 25, 2025)
- **Backer Management**: Reward tracking and fulfillment coordination

### Post-Campaign Operations

- **Data Migration**: Customer data from Kickstarter to Shopify
- **Fulfillment Planning**: Reward delivery logistics
- **GTM Strategy**: Go-to-market plan for ongoing sales

## Tools & Technologies

### Strategic Planning

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
Created comprehensive GTM one-pager covering:

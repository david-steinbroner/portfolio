**Making local politics more transparent and accessible to citizens.**

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

Here's a weird fact: the government decisions that affect your daily life the most are the ones you're least likely to know about.

Zoning changes that determine what gets built on your block. Budget votes that decide whether your kid's school gets funding. Public safety policies that shape how your neighborhood is policed. These all happen at city council meetings and county board sessions—and almost nobody's watching.

It's not because people don't care. It's because the information is scattered across a dozen different websites, buried in PDFs, and announced in ways that assume you're already paying attention. If you wanted to follow local government like you follow the news, you'd basically need a part-time job.

## What I Built

Local Government Watch aggregates local government activity—meetings, votes, legislation, decisions—into one place. You can search across jurisdictions, track topics you care about, and get notified when something relevant happens.

Right now it covers California's North Bay: Marin, Sonoma, and Napa counties, plus their major cities. That's intentional—I'm working directly with people in local government there, which means real users and real feedback as I build.

**Unified search** across state, county, and city government activity.

**Topic tracking** — set keywords like "housing" or "climate" and see everything related.

**Meeting calendar** — upcoming sessions across all jurisdictions in one view.

**Legislation history** — see how bills and proposals evolve over time.

**Email digests** — weekly summaries so you don't have to check constantly.

## Who It's For

**Government workers** who need to track what's happening across jurisdictions—not just their own.

**Regular citizens** who want to participate in local democracy but don't have hours to spend hunting down information. Local government is where change actually happens. School boards, city councils, county supervisors—these are the people making decisions about your neighborhood, and they're accessible in ways that federal politicians aren't.

But you can't engage with decisions you don't know are being made.

## Why This Matters to Me

I believe transparency is a prerequisite for participation. Right now, the information asymmetry favors lobbyists, developers, and anyone with resources to hire someone to watch government for them.

This is an attempt to level that playing field a little.

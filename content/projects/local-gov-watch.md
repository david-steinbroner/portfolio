## Overview

A civic technology platform that aggregates and tracks local government meetings, votes, and decisions. The goal is to make local politics more transparent and accessible to everyday citizens.

## Problem

## Key Features

- Automated meeting tracking and agenda scraping
- Vote history and representative accountability tracking

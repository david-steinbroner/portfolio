**No lore required. No gatekeeping.**

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

Magic: The Gathering has been around for 30 years, and in that time it's built up... a lot. Thousands of cards. Decades of lore. A vocabulary that sounds like a foreign language if you're not already in the club. ("Oh, you're running Dimir control with a Thoracle wincon? Nice.")

Here's the thing: there's a card for everyone. There are pirates and dinosaurs and eldritch horrors and cats with swords. There's comedy and tragedy and genuinely beautiful art. But most people never find their way in because the front door feels like it's guarded by people who've been playing since 1993.

I wanted to build a different kind of door.

## What I Built

Discovering Magic is a platform that helps people who've never played find their way into the game—without requiring homework first.

**Curated entry points.** I hand-picked decks and cards that challenge what people *think* Magic is. If you assume it's all dragons and wizards, wait until you see the deck built around squirrels. Or the one that's basically a heist movie. These aren't random—they're chosen to spark curiosity.

**A personality-based quiz.** Instead of asking "What's your favorite mana color?" (meaningless to a new player), I ask questions like "Do you want to be the hero or the mastermind?" and match you to a playstyle. You get one recommendation—not a wall of options.

**Education that respects your time.** Short explanations of how Commander works, why it's the best format for playing with friends, and what you actually need to get started. No jargon. No gatekeeping.

## Why Commander?

Commander is having a moment. It's the most social format—you play with 3-4 friends, games are longer and more dramatic, and there's a culture of creativity over competition. Wizards of the Coast sells ready-to-play preconstructed decks for around $50. That's a real on-ramp.

But the on-ramp only works if someone helps you find it.

## Why Mobile-First?

Most people browse on their phones. More importantly, this is meant to be shared—someone texts a friend "hey, you'd actually like this game," and that link needs to work beautifully on a phone screen. The whole point is lowering barriers, and a desktop-only experience is a barrier.

**Preserving a moment when 1,001 people stepped into a fairytale.**

## The Project

In 2007, artist Ai Weiwei did something extraordinary: he invited 1,001 people from Mainland China to travel to Kassel, Germany for Documenta 12, one of Europe's most prestigious art exhibitions. For many participants, it was their first time leaving China. Their first time on an airplane. Their first encounter with a world outside everything they knew.

The project was called "Fairytale"—童话—because Kassel is the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm, and because there's something fairytale-like about a farmer or laborer from rural China suddenly walking through a German art exhibition.

Ai Weiwei interviewed participants, collected questionnaires, gathered thousands of photographs. The Fairytale Project website, created in collaboration with the Slought Foundation, archives these materials in Chinese, English, and German.

## The Problem

The original site was built years ago on technology that was about to be deprecated. The hosting service was updating their infrastructure, and the PHP-based site was going to go offline. Years of cultural documentation—interviews, images, translations—would simply disappear.

## What I Did

I rebuilt the entire site from scratch as a static HTML site in three weeks.

The goal wasn't to redesign it—it was to *preserve* it. Keep the same experience, the same navigation, the same access to 4,898 curated images and translated interviews. Just make it work on modern infrastructure so it can stay online indefinitely.

This was contract work for Slought Foundation, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit focused on art and cultural research. The site is now live and stable.

## Why This Matters

Some websites are just websites. This one is a cultural document. It preserves the voices of 1,001 people reflecting on identity, memory, dreams, and what it means to leave home. In a world where digital archives disappear constantly, keeping this one alive felt important.

**Code it. Print it. Use it.**

## Why I Started

I got a Bambu A1 3D printer and quickly realized: downloading other people's designs is fine, but the real power is making exactly what you need.

The problem is, traditional CAD software has a steep learning curve, and I already know how to code. OpenSCAD lets you design 3D objects by writing code—dimensions as variables, shapes as functions, parametric designs you can tweak and re-render instantly.

So I started learning.

## What I've Made

**Practical household fixes.** A bracket for a hood light broke. Instead of hunting for a replacement part or buying a whole new fixture, I measured, modeled, and printed a new one. Total cost: a few cents of filament and an hour of my time.

**Costume props.** For Renaissance Faire, I designed and printed a Scottish dirk—a traditional dagger. I could have bought a cheap plastic one, but I wanted something that looked right and fit my hand. Designing it myself meant I got exactly what I pictured.

**Random tools and holders.** Cable organizers, drawer dividers, phone stands—small objects that solve small problems.

## Why This Belongs in My Portfolio

This isn't a software project, but it's the same skill pattern: see a problem, learn what you need to learn, build a solution.

OpenSCAD is a programming language. Designing for 3D printing requires thinking about tolerances, material properties, and structural integrity. The iteration cycle—design, print, test, adjust—is the same loop as software development.

It's also just fun. There's something satisfying about holding a physical object you designed in code.

## The Setup

**Printer:** Bambu A1
**Design tool:** OpenSCAD
**Materials:** PLA, PETG depending on the application

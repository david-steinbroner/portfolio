## Overview

Led the end-to-end product launch of Fold's Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card—the first credit card in the U.S. to offer Bitcoin rewards on every purchase. This 0→1 product required deep cross-functional coordination across Engineering, Design, Compliance, Banking Partners, Support, Growth, and Finance teams.

## The Challenge

**Market Opportunity**: Bitcoin was gaining mainstream adoption, but there was no easy way for everyday consumers to earn Bitcoin through their normal spending habits.

**Technical Complexity**: Building a credit card product requires:
- Banking partner integration and approval processes
- Complex compliance and regulatory requirements (KYC, AML, credit underwriting)
- Rewards calculation and Bitcoin settlement infrastructure
- Card issuance and fulfillment logistics
- Customer support systems for credit-specific issues

**Competitive Landscape**: We were racing against other fintech companies to be first-to-market with a Bitcoin rewards credit card.

## My Role

As Product Manager, I:

### Product Strategy & Vision
- Defined product requirements and feature set based on user research and competitive analysis
- Created PRDs (Product Requirements Documents) for engineering
- Prioritized features for MVP vs. future iterations
- Developed go-to-market strategy and positioning

### Cross-Functional Leadership
- **Engineering**: Coordinated backend infrastructure, rewards calculation engine, and mobile app integration
- **Design**: Collaborated on physical card design, app UX, and onboarding flows
- **Compliance**: Navigated regulatory requirements and banking partner approval processes
- **Growth**: Planned waitlist strategy, launch communications, and user acquisition campaigns
- **Support**: Built knowledge base, trained support team, created escalation procedures
- **Finance**: Structured rewards economics and unit economics modeling

### Launch Execution

- Ran beta testing program with 500+ early adopters
- Coordinated phased rollout strategy to manage risk
- Monitored metrics daily and iterated based on user feedback

## Technical Details

### Infrastructure

- Real-time fraud detection and prevention

### Mobile App Integration
- React Native implementation for iOS and Android

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. Regulatory Approval Process
**Challenge**: Banking partner approval process typically takes 12+ months.

**Solution**: I created detailed documentation showing user demand (40K waitlist signups), conducted competitive analysis, and worked directly with bank compliance team to address concerns proactively. Reduced approval timeline to 8 months.

### 2. Rewards Economics
**Challenge**: Bitcoin price volatility made rewards economics unpredictable.

**Solution**: Modeled multiple scenarios, built dynamic rewards rate system that could adjust based on Bitcoin price and spending patterns. Created financial model that maintained profitability across 80% price swing scenarios.

### 3. User Education
**Challenge**: Credit card users didn't understand Bitcoin or how to manage Bitcoin rewards.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive onboarding flow with interactive tutorials, built FAQ system, and implemented contextual help throughout app. Reduced support tickets by 40% compared to debit card launch.

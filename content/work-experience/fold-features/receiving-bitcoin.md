## Overview

Launched feature enabling users to receive bitcoin directly into their Fold account, making Fold a complete bitcoin ecosystem where users can earn, buy, sell, send, and receive bitcoin all in one place.

## Problem

Users could buy bitcoin within Fold but couldn't receive bitcoin from external sources. This created friction for users who wanted to consolidate their bitcoin holdings or receive payments from others.

## Solution

Built a complete bitcoin receiving infrastructure that:
- Generated unique bitcoin addresses for each user
- Enabled QR code sharing for easy payments
- Provided transaction history and confirmations
- Integrated with existing bitcoin custody infrastructure

## Key Responsibilities

- **Cross-functional coordination**: Worked with Engineering, Design, Compliance, and Operations teams
- **Technical integration**: Coordinated with custody partner and internal backend systems
- **Go-to-market**: Planned launch communications and user education
- **Compliance**: Ensured regulatory requirements were met

## Impact

- **50% increase** in month-over-month bitcoin trading volume
- **35% adoption** rate in the first month after launch
- Critical feature that contributed to Fold's successful path to going public
- Completed the core bitcoin functionality loop (earn, buy, sell, send, receive)

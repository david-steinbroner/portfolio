Integrated TaxBit to deliver 1099-B forms and Gain/Loss summaries to users who sold bitcoin. Built the Taxes & Documents section, W-9 collection flow, and support tooling.

The feature includes educational framing so users understand what each document means, two download options (PDF for 80% who want simple, CSV for 20% who need raw data), and conditional entry points based on eligibility.

**Fold was launching its first credit card product.** We needed to build demand before the product existed, validate interest, and create a pool of qualified early adopters.

## What I Built

End-to-end waitlist campaign with two components:

**Sweepstakes:** External landing page, eligibility rules, prize fulfillment. I manually verified winners to prevent fraud—fake referrals, duplicate accounts, bot signups.

**Waitlist competition:** Users earned points through in-app behavior (card usage, referrals, engagement) that moved them up the waitlist. This drove revenue and activity during the pre-launch phase while building the signup list.

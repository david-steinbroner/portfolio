The ability to sell bitcoin and instantly fund your Fold Card was one of three features that completed the Bitcoin Flywheel - turning Fold from a place to earn bitcoin into a complete bitcoin financial ecosystem.

## What It Is

A flow that lets users sell their bitcoin holdings and have the USD immediately available on their Fold Card. No waiting for bank transfers, no external exchanges. Sell bitcoin, spend dollars, all within the same app.

## What I Built

**The sell flow UX** - Designed the end-to-end experience from initiating a sale to confirmation. Key decisions included showing real-time BTC/USD conversion, displaying fee breakdowns transparently, and making the Fold Card the default (and only) destination for funds.

**Fee transparency component** - Created a reusable component showing fee breakdowns for any transaction. For Spin+ members paying no fees, it reinforces their membership value. For free users, it serves as an upgrade entry point ("Upgrade to Spin+ for no fees") with a path back to the flow after upgrading.

**Auto-fund to Fold Card** - Rather than offering multiple destinations (bank account, hold as USD, etc.), I pushed for the Fold Card as the only option. This was intentional: it keeps users in the Fold ecosystem and reinforces the flywheel. Every bitcoin sold becomes spending power on the card, which earns more bitcoin.

## Why It Matters

Before this feature, users who wanted to spend their bitcoin had to transfer it to an external exchange, sell it, withdraw to a bank account, and wait days. We collapsed that into seconds.

Combined with Receiving Bitcoin and Direct to Bitcoin, this completed the loop: earn bitcoin through rewards, receive bitcoin from external wallets, sell when you need dollars, spend on the card, earn more bitcoin.

## Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end feature ownership from strategy through launch
- Cross-functional coordination with engineering, finance, compliance, and legal
- UX design for financial flows requiring trust and transparency
- Strategic product thinking (ecosystem lock-in through simplicity)

**Sell bitcoin, fund your card, spend dollars—all in one app.** No waiting for bank transfers, no external exchanges.

The ability to sell bitcoin and instantly fund your Fold Card was one of three features that completed the Bitcoin Flywheel—turning Fold from a place to earn bitcoin into a complete bitcoin financial ecosystem.

## What I Built

**The sell flow UX** - Designed the end-to-end experience from initiating a sale to confirmation. Key decisions included showing real-time BTC/USD conversion, displaying fee breakdowns transparently, and making the Fold Card the default destination for funds.

**Fee transparency component** - Created a reusable component showing fee breakdowns for any transaction. For Spin+ members paying no fees, it reinforces their membership value. For free users, it serves as an upgrade entry point with a path back to the flow after upgrading.

**Auto-fund to Fold Card** - Rather than offering multiple destinations (bank account, hold as USD, etc.), I pushed for the Fold Card as the only option. This keeps users in the Fold ecosystem and reinforces the flywheel. Every bitcoin sold becomes spending power on the card, which earns more bitcoin.

## Key Product Decision

Why only the Fold Card as a destination? We could have offered bank transfers or holding USD in-app. But every option you add is friction, and every off-ramp out of the ecosystem breaks the flywheel. By making the card the only destination, we made the simplest possible flow while keeping users engaged in the earn-hold-spend cycle.

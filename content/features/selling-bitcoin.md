Launched bitcoin selling functionality that automatically funds the Fold Card with USD proceeds. No intermediate account, no manual transfers—money goes directly where users need it to spend.

The feature includes real-time sat/dollar conversion, fee transparency showing "$0.00 processing fee" for premium members, and a confirmation flow that breaks down exactly what users will receive.

*Screenshots coming soon*

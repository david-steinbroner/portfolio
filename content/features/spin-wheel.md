Built a daily spin wheel that became Fold's most engaging feature. Users spin daily for a chance to win sats, driving a 23% increase in daily active users and 2.7x more app opens per week.

The feature required cross-functional coordination across product, engineering, marketing, legal, and external partners. I managed the full lifecycle from concept through launch and ongoing optimization.

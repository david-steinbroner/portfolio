**Most people want to stack Bitcoin but forget to do it.** They have good intentions, but manual buying requires opening the app, deciding how much, and executing—friction that kills follow-through.

Direct to Bitcoin removed the friction entirely.

## What I Built

Users could set a percentage of every deposit—paycheck, transfer, any inbound funds—to automatically convert to Bitcoin. Set it once, forget it, stack sats forever.

This was the final piece of Fold's Bitcoin ecosystem. Combined with Sell Bitcoin and Receive Bitcoin, users now had a complete financial loop: money comes in, automatically converts to Bitcoin, and can be sent or sold whenever needed.

**The key insight:** People don't want to think about buying Bitcoin. They want to have bought Bitcoin. Auto-buy turns intention into action without requiring ongoing decisions.

Shipped automatic bitcoin conversion on every deposit. Users choose 1-100% of deposits to convert, with preset buttons for 25%, 50%, and 100%. Zero fees for premium members.

This feature removes the friction of timing and decision fatigue. Instead of manually buying bitcoin, users set it once and accumulate automatically on every deposit.

*Screenshots coming soon*

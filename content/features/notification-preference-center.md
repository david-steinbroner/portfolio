**Users had no control over what Fold sent them.** Every notification—promotional, transactional, security—went to everyone. This created two problems: users got annoyed and turned off notifications entirely, and we faced compliance risk around required communications.

## What I Built

A self-service preference center where users could choose exactly what they wanted to receive: marketing promotions, transaction alerts, security notifications, product updates.

I worked with legal to identify which notifications were legally required (couldn't be turned off) vs. optional. Then designed the UI to make choices clear without overwhelming users with options.

Built the receive flow enabling users to bring bitcoin into Fold from any external wallet. Features include QR code display, truncated address with one-tap copy, and full address reveal.

These were must-haves I fought for—table stakes for any bitcoin wallet. Without the ability to bring bitcoin in, users who already owned bitcoin elsewhere couldn't participate in the Fold ecosystem.

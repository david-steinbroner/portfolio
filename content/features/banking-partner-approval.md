**Every feature that touched payments required approval from our banking partner.** The existing process took 4+ weeks: submit materials, wait, get questions, answer them, wait again. This killed velocity on the roadmap.

## What I Built

I rebuilt the workflow from scratch:

- Established a direct relationship with our banking partner contact (previously all communication went through account management layers)
- Defined exactly what they needed for approval: annotated wireframes, user flow documentation, compliance justification
- Created templates that anticipated their questions
- Set up regular check-ins instead of async back-and-forth

## The Impact

- **Reduced approval timeline by 75%** (from 4+ weeks to days)
- Established Product as direct point of contact with banking partner
- Created repeatable process for future feature approvals
- Unblocked multiple roadmap items that had been stuck in approval limbo
